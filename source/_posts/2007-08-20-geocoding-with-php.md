title: Geocoding with php
teaser: Recently one of our customers asked us to pimp his project database. This database is a pool of european wide projects in non-formal learning and youth work. The customer wanted the projects to be shown on a map of europe to emphasize their extensiveness. Unless we wanted somebody to put each of the over 500 projects on the map manually, we had to find a way to use a geocoder, because we had nothing more than a description text including address information like "Athens, Greece".
