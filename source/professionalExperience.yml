            title: Introducing Docker & Kubernetes
            description: |
              In 2014 Chefkoch decided to move towards a Microservice architecture.
              Right at the same time Docker arrived and we thought it is a perfect match.
              After some initial experiments on how to run PHP-based web applications
              in containers and orchestrating them with CoreOS' Fleet, we felt a need for a more flexible
              orchestration solution. We finally decided for Kubernetes and launched our first microservice
              to a production cluster, just days after Kubernetes 1.0 was released in July 2015.

              New mobile apps launched in February 2014 needed a fresh REST API to get their data from.
              We used this API to introduce the Web Application Framework Symfony2 to the company.
              It was also the first project at Chefkoch were automated tests and Continuous Integration were used.

            title: DevOps & Refactoring our infrastructure
            description: |
              In January 2018 I was one of two colleagues from Software Development that joined our ops team.
              Our mission was to finalize the transition to Kubernetes and get rid of all servers
              that were not running containers. That also ment refactoring all remaining applications
              (monoliths & microservices) to run in Kubernetes. We also introduced a complete new
              monitoring and logging setup based on Filebeat, Prometheus, Grafana and ElasticStack (ELK).
              We are currently looking into how cloud computing can further improve our operations.

            title: Introducing Google Analytics
            description: |
              In summer 2017 I led a Scrum development team as "Technical Product Owner". One of our greater epics was
              to move all tracking at Chefkoch from WebTrekk to Google Analytics. One goal of this transition was to
              reduce inconsistencies in the tracked data as we heavily rely on them for our sales customers.
              We quickly designed and launched a static Javascript middleware that contained all logic to map
              information from our HTML web pages to Google Analytics. The middleware was written in a testdriven
              approach to ensure complete test coverage of all mapping logic. Se setup also included a logging solution
              enabling us to see any mapping errors happening within the browser of our users.

            title: Migrating a self-written CMS to an open-source solution (Drupal)
            description: |
              In early 2016 I was part of a new Scrum development team. Its mission was to migrate all
              editorial content from some self-written CMS to an open-source solution (Drupal).
              The project was quite difficult as it also included a complete UX/UI redesign of the content
              and some new native sales products on top of it. We managed to launch the new CMS to our Kubernetes
              cluster in about 11 month. As Drupal is quite slow performance-wise, the setup included sophisticated
              caching based on Redis (backend) and Varnish (HTTP).
